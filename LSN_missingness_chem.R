### Analysis of missing data in LSN network
### Chemistry (Water quality - WIMS)

### This script generates the missing data, refer to report file for analysis and plots.
### This script has been modified from Ben's original to run on RSTudio workbench 

# Missing data is not recorded, its just missing.
# Find which months have missing values by reshaping data by month - this will add NaN to sites with missing data for each month
# Some network id's have multiple values per month - for the purposes of finding missing data, just calculate a mean.
# Not all sites are monitored each year.
# Chemistry = 100 sites a year
